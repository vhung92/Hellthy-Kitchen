<p>Hellthy Kitchen is a virtual reality game created by 3 students at KTH in the course Advanced Graphics and Interactions (DH2413). This is our second project in the course and the aim of the project was to promote healthy living. All the other groups focused on having the player move around in order to get some exercise while playing, we wanted to be different and chose to implement the healthy aspect inside the game, in the form of teaching the player how to cook healthy food. The player still gets to move around but needs to do so in a more delicate manner in order to interact with the environment, e.g. turning on the stove, turning on the faucet, moving the ingredients etc.</p>

<p>We originally wanted the purpose of the game to be that the player gets a recipe which they have to follow by picking the right ingredients from the fridge, cutting them into smaller pieces, and finally putting them into either a frying pan or a pot. But we soon realized that our ambition was set too high seeing as we only had 3 weeks to complete this project. With that in mind we decided to focus more on making the game fun and interactive. So the current state of the game has no actual gameplay or purpose, but it’s almost fully interactive and when we showcased the project at KTH Visualization Studio’s Open House event we could see a smile on the face of every visitor trying out our “kitchen simulator”.</p>

<p>The game was created using Blender for modeling and texturing, CrazyBump for bumpmapping and Unity3D for the actual game and game logic. The game utilizes the Oculus Rift DK2(DK1 faktiskt) for the virtual reality experience, the Microsoft Xbox 360 Kinect for tracking the user’s body movement and 2 Targus wireless USB presenters for activating the grip function of respective hand.</p>
<!-- <p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p> -->
